This challenage will get 2 file.One is encrypto png.Another is encrypt.py which is how to encrypt png file.

Review the code,That is easy to decrypto,It's use XOR key to encrypt png file.

First time need to find XOR key,length is 12 bytes.

And it give you encryp.png,So you can use this encryp.png's header and another normal png's header.

Then you will get XOR key to decrypto file.
